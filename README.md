# Game-2048

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ replica of the popular 2048 game, created for educational purposes to explore and implement game development principles. It faithfully replicates the original game's mechanics, utilizing custom graphics and supporting keyboard controls for gameplay. The project is structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, showcasing the separation of game logic, user interaction, and graphical display.

## Features
- **MVC Architecture**: Organizes code into distinct model, view, and controller components, facilitating clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
- **Graphical Interface**: Implements custom graphics for the game board, tiles, and animations, enhancing the user experience with visually appealing elements.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Allows players to use arrow keys for gameplay, mirroring the intuitive controls of the original 2048 game.
- **Custom Game Engine Integration**: Demonstrates the capability to integrate and utilize a custom game engine for handling game state and rendering.

## Controls
Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the tiles on the board. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch, adding up their values. Try and get a 2048 tile!


## Purpose
This project serves as a showcase of my ability to handle a comprehensive software development project, including the integration of graphics, user input handling, and the application of software design patterns such as MVC. It demonstrates my proficiency in C++ and my capability to create engaging and complex graphical applications.
